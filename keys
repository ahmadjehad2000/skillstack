# CourseGen AI Project Overview

## Project Description
CourseGen AI is a sophisticated educational content generation system that combines OpenAI's GPT-4o and Stable Diffusion to create comprehensive, ready-to-use courses on any topic. The system generates a single, high-quality comprehensive lesson with all necessary educational components including assessments, examples, and visual elements.

## Key Components

### 1. Course Content Generation
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o for high-quality educational content
- Implements robust anti-hallucination measures to prevent nonsensical content
- Generates structured markdown content with proper formatting
- Creates assessment questions with multiple-choice and scenario-based options

### 2. Visual Content Generation
- Uses Stable Diffusion for course thumbnail generation
- Optimized for GTX 1050 Ti GPU with 4GB VRAM
- Implements multiple fallback mechanisms for image generation
- Adds professional text overlay to thumbnails

### 3. Web Application
- Flask-based web interface for easy course generation
- Dashboard for managing generated courses
- Real-time course generation status updates
- Ability to download courses in JSON format

## Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Python with Flask web framework
- **AI Models**: OpenAI API for text, Stable Diffusion for images
- **UI**: Bootstrap-based responsive interface with dynamic content loading
- **Storage**: File-based storage for generated content and thumbnails
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Windows environment with relative path handling

## Notable Features

1. **Anti-Hallucination System**: Sophisticated content filtering that prevents repetitive or nonsensical content generation through:
   - Enhanced prompting techniques
   - Post-processing filters for detecting repetition patterns
   - Specialized handling for problematic content sections

2. **Memory Optimization**: Careful management of GPU resources to work within 4GB VRAM constraints:
   - Dynamic model loading/unloading
   - Optimized image generation parameters
   - Multi-stage fallback system for thumbnail creation

3. **Single-Lesson Format**: Consolidated course structure that delivers a comprehensive masterclass on any topic rather than multiple small lessons, focusing on quality over quantity.

## Current Status
The project is functional with all major components working. Recent improvements include:
- Fixing hallucination issues in generated content
- Implementing improved assessment question generation with checkbox formatting
- Enhancing error handling for more stable operation
- Optimizing thumbnail generation for reliable operation on limited GPU memory

The code is well-documented with extensive error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable operation even under suboptimal conditions.
